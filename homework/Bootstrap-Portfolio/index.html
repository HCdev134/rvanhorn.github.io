                    <p>Hello there! My name is
                        <strong>Richard Van Horn</strong>.</p>

                    <p>I've always had a fascination with computers that started at an early age thanks to my dad who was a
                        network engineer. From a young age I was taking apart computers, replacing parts and building them
                        from scratch. I was always curious as a child and remember one instance where I "taught" myself DOS
                        so I could load DOOM as my dad, who usually did it for me was not home and I really wanted to play.</p>

                    <p>As I got older, my attention and curiosity turned towards the internet and started using Microsoft Frontpage
                        to create basic websites which I thought were pretty awesome at the time. While I didn't have any
                        flaming text on my first website, it did have a rainbow marquee and a gif of a dragon that would
                        fly below the marquee. As time continued on I developed my coding skills and started making more
                        intricate websites and used GeoCities, among other hosts to host and share them with my friends.
                    </p>

                    <p>I continued with my passion learning new skills and took an intro into web development that was first
                        offered my senior year of highschool. As I continued on I took a couple different coding classes
                        in college but ended up switching my major as I didn't want my passion to become something I hated.
                        After graduating college, I worked in an office as an account manager but always felt out of place
                        and slowly started getting back into coding which made me realize that its what I would rather be
                        doing for a career.</p>
